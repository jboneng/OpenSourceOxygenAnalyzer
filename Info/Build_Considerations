The signal from the O2 cell(s) are very weak and is easly disrupted by electormagnetic noise, care should be taken to use good shealded
cords for the communication between the ADS1015 and the cell, care should also be taken in the physical layout so the signal cords from the cell
is not to close to other cords or electromagnetic sources.

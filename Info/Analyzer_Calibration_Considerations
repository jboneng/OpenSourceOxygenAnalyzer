The calibration should be done with dry air, with an o2 percent of aprox. 21%. If calibrating against air from a high pressure tank
make sure the flow is not to strong, the air flow should be weak.

The firmware does not per 20 march of 2020 support calibratin against 100% O2 or other gas mixes with known o2 percent, but this
functionality should be easy to implement in the firmware if needed.
